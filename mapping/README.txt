Place your .map made in Trenchbroom here ! 
Use 'giap_compile <map_name>' or 'giap_compile_all' in the gigno console.
A <map_name> directory will have appeared in the 'assets/maps/' directory.
Only one manual step remains : use the Trenchbroom export option to 'export the map as a wavefront obj' and place the output within the 'assets/maps/<map_name>/visuals' directory.

Your Trenchbroom map is now usabe in gigno :)

------------------------------------------
To make maps in trenchbroom, follow instructions at this adress : https://trenchbroom.github.io/manual/latest/#game_configuration_files
using the mapping/trenchbroom_config directory, which contains trenchbroom configurations, as well as a .fgd file listing existing entities.
If new entities are not acounted for, use the console command 'giap_write_fgd' to regenerate an updated .fgd file.
