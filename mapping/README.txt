Place your .map made in Trenchbroom here ! 
Use 'giap_compile <map_name>' or 'giap_compile_all' in the gigno console.
A <map_name> directory will have appeared in the 'assets/maps/' directory.
Only one manual step remains : use the Trenchbroom export option to 'export the map as a wavefront obj' and place the output within the 'assets/maps/<map_name>/visuals' directory.

Your Trenchbroom map is now usabe in gigno :)
