On the style of the code :
- PascalCase for Classes
- PascalCase_t for enum and structs
- PascalCase for methods.
- PascalCase for public class/structs variables
- m_PascalCaseWithM for private ('member') class/struct variables
- snake_case for scope variables defined in a method.
- camelCase for function parameter.
- Precede pointer name with a 'p' : pThisIsPointer (if meaningful. char *, for exemple, is not meaningful)
- 'public:' block before 'private:' block in class header.
- snake_case.h for file names.
